# Who am I ?

My name is **Shivam Varshney**. I passed my Engineering in Computer Science from Zakir Hussain College of Engineering & Technology, AMU Aligarh.I belongs from a small town of UP, India. I started my coding journey in 2015 when I needed to build a website for my interest. After devoting 3 years to coding, Web & Android Development, in 2018 I shifted my interest into the field of Data Science. Since then, I breathe data. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer in Envestnet Yodlee, leading data aggregation and data analytics platform powering dynamic, cloud-based innovation for digital financial services.
